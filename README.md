# Country-Wise CO₂ Emissions Statistical Analysis (1970–2020)

## Project Overview
This repository contains the solution and analysis for a statistical project focused on country-wise CO₂ emissions from 1970 to 2020. The project analyzes emissions data for the world's top 10 economies, applying statistical methods to uncover patterns, variability, and trends over five decades. The analysis is based on annual CO₂ emissions and GDP data, filtered for consistency and comparability.

The primary goal is to provide insights into how major economies have contributed to global CO₂ emissions historically, highlighting differences in emission levels, variability, and influencing factors such as industrialization, energy policies, and economic transformations.

Key components include:
- Data preparation and filtering for top 10 countries by GDP (using 1970 figures for consistency).
- Statistical calculations (mean, variance, standard deviation, min, max) at decade intervals (1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020).
- Summary tables and interpretations for each decade.
- Cumulative emission charts and country-specific insights.
- Broader interpretations on trends, outliers, and possible reasons for observed differences.

This project was completed as part of a class activity, with results presented in a structured report format. The repository may include the original dataset (e.g., Excel file), calculations, graphs/charts for visualization, and this README as a concise report.

## Objectives
- Analyze and compare CO₂ emissions for the top 10 global economies over 50 years.
- Apply statistical methods to quantify emission patterns and variability.
- Identify trends, outliers, and key influencers (e.g., economic changes, policies, industrialization).
- Present findings in clear, comparative tables and interpretive comments.

## Data Preparation
- **Dataset Sources**: Annual CO₂ emissions (country-wise) and GDP data from 1970–2020 (sourced from provided Excel file).
- **Country Selection**: Top 10 countries by GDP around 1970 for consistency: United States, Russia, Germany, United Kingdom, Japan, India, France, Canada, China, Italy (inferred from analysis).
- **Filtering**: Include only these countries with valid data for decade intervals (1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020). Missing data is addressed transparently by cleaning or noting omissions.
- **Time Frame**: Emissions at decade starts (e.g., 1970-1980 decade uses data from 1970, 1980, etc., but calculations are based on annual data within periods where specified).

## Methodology: Data Analysis
For each of the 10 countries and each decade:
1. Extract annual CO₂ emissions.
2. Calculate key statistics:
   - **Mean (Average)**: Average CO₂ emissions.
   - **Variance**: Measure of emission spread.
   - **Standard Deviation**: Square root of variance for variability insight.
   - **Minimum**: Lowest emission value.
   - **Maximum**: Highest emission value.
3. Structure results in summary tables (one per decade).
4. Interpret results, including highest/lowest means, largest/smallest variability, trends, outliers, and potential reasons.

Visualizations (e.g., charts/graphs) are recommended for emission trends and cumulative contributions.

## Key Findings: Cumulative Chart Overview (1970–2020)
This analysis presents the cumulative percentage of global CO₂ emissions attributed to major countries over 50 years, emphasizing long-term contributions:

- **United States**: 45% – Largest contributor due to high industrial activity, energy consumption, and fossil fuel reliance.
- **Russia**: 13% – Elevated during Soviet era from heavy industry; sustained by fossil fuels.
- **Germany**: 10% – Historical coal-based emissions; recent reforms reducing impact.
- **United Kingdom**: 8% – Early industrialization; recent decline from deindustrialization and renewables.
- **Japan**: 7% – Post-war growth and fossil fuel imports.
- **India**: 6% – Lower share despite population; recent increases from industrialization.
- **France**: 4% – Low due to early nuclear energy adoption.
- **Canada**: 4% – High relative to population from oil extraction.
- **Unlabelled/Other**: 3% – Minor contributors.

### Insights from Cumulative Analysis
- **Historical Responsibility**: Developed nations (U.S., UK, Germany) have high shares from early industrialization.
- **Energy Strategy Impact**: France's nuclear focus yields low emissions.
- **Population vs. Emissions**: India's low share reflects lower per capita emissions.
- **Economic Structure**: Resource-heavy countries (Canada, Russia) show elevated emissions.

## Decade-Specific Analysis
Below is a summary of statistical findings and interpretations for each decade, based on calculated values.

### 1970–1980
- **Highest Mean**: United States (4,687,380,727 kt) – Significant global contribution.
- **Lowest Mean**: India (2,337,032,87.3 kt) – Relatively smaller emissions.
- **Largest Variability**: China (Variance: 6.52322×10¹⁶; Std Dev: 2,555,823,329.5) – Substantial fluctuations.

### 2000–2010
- **Focus on Influences**:
  - China/India: High growth and variability from industrialization and fossil fuels.
  - United States: High stable emissions from economy size.
  - United Kingdom: Decline from deindustrialization and renewables.
  - France: Low variability from nuclear energy.
  - Germany: Mixed from energy transition.

- **Highest Mean**: China – Driven by manufacturing, coal, and urbanization.
- **Lowest Mean**: France – Nuclear energy minimizes fossil fuel use.
- **Highest Variability**: China – Economic cycles and policy shifts.
- **Lowest Variability**: France – Stable nuclear reliance.
- **Influences**:
  - Industrialization: High emissions in China/India.
  - Economic Maturity: Stable in U.S./Germany/UK.
  - Energy Policy: Low in nuclear-focused France.

## Overall Interpretation and Insights
- **Trends**: Emissions are highest and most stable in developed nations (e.g., U.S., Japan) due to mature economies. Emerging economies (China, India) show high variability from rapid growth.
- **Outliers**: Often linked to economic shifts (e.g., China's industrialization phases) or events (e.g., Russia's post-Soviet contraction, Japan's Fukushima impact).
- **Reasons for Differences**:
  - **Economic Changes**: Industrialization boosts emissions in developing countries; deindustrialization reduces them in mature ones.
  - **Policy**: Nuclear/renewable adoption (France, UK) lowers emissions; fossil fuel reliance (China, Russia) increases them.
  - **Other Factors**: Population size, per capita consumption, and historical events play roles.
- **Recommendations**: Focus on renewables and policy reforms to reduce variability and overall emissions.
