# Statistical-Analysis-of-Global-CO2-Emission-of-five-decades-i.e..-1970---2020
An analysis of CO₂ emissions (1970-2020) for the top 10 economies. The data shows high variability in emerging nations like China due to industrialization , while mature economies are more stable. France's nuclear policy contributes to its consistently low emissions.

# Statistical Analysis of Country-Wise CO₂ Emissions (1970–2020)

### Objective
[cite_start]This project provides a statistical analysis of CO₂ emissions for the world's top 10 economies over five decades, from 1970 to 2020[cite: 3]. [cite_start]The goal is to apply statistical methods to gain insights into emission patterns, compare variability between countries, and identify significant trends over time[cite: 3].

### Dataset
[cite_start]The analysis is based on a dataset of annual, country-wise CO₂ emissions and GDP data for the period 1970–2020[cite: 6]. [cite_start]The top 10 countries were selected based on their GDP figures from around 1970 to ensure consistency across the time period[cite: 7].

### Methodology
[cite_start]The analysis was conducted for each decade from 1970 to 2020[cite: 10]. [cite_start]For each of the 10 selected countries, the following statistical measures were calculated for their annual CO₂ emissions[cite: 13, 14]:
* [cite_start]**Mean** (Average) CO₂ emissions [cite: 16]
* [cite_start]**Emission Variance** [cite: 17]
* [cite_start]**Standard Deviation** [cite: 18]
* [cite_start]**Minimum** and **Maximum** emission values [cite: 19, 20]

### Key Findings & Interpretation

A summary of the key trends observed across the decades:

* **Emission Leaders**:
    * [cite_start]The **United States** consistently had the highest mean CO₂ emissions in the earlier decades (1970-2000)[cite: 87, 104, 119].
    * [cite_start]**China**'s emissions grew rapidly, eventually surpassing the U.S. to become the country with the highest average emissions in the 2010-2020 period[cite: 158].
    * [cite_start]**France** consistently demonstrated one of the lowest average emissions among these economies, largely due to its early adoption of nuclear energy[cite: 161, 181].

* **Emission Variability**:
    * [cite_start]**China** consistently exhibited the highest emission variability (largest variance and standard deviation), reflecting its rapid and fluctuating industrial growth[cite: 88, 105, 120, 165].
    * [cite_start]**France** and other mature European economies like the **United Kingdom** and **Germany** generally showed the lowest variability, indicating more stable and predictable emission patterns[cite: 88, 105, 120, 168].

* **General Trends**:
    * [cite_start]**Mature Economies** (e.g., U.S., UK, Germany) show high but relatively stable emission levels, reflecting their post-industrial economic structure[cite: 177, 187].
    * [cite_start]**Emerging Economies** (e.g., China, India) display high growth and significant volatility in emissions, directly linked to rapid industrialization, urbanization, and changing energy policies[cite: 173, 175, 186].
    * Energy policy has a clear impact. [cite_start]**France's** long-term reliance on nuclear power resulted in a consistently low carbon footprint [cite: 71, 145][cite_start], while **Canada's** energy-intensive industries contribute to high emissions relative to its population[cite: 74, 75].
